          <p class="project-description portfolio-card-p">Designed the portfolio web application to operate as a 'sandbox' mode. I am drawn to the thought, that having a 'sandbox' to code in, provides me the unique opportunity to help broaden my skill set as I implement new features. The portfolio 'sandbox' also gives me the ability to create more depth in technical tools I've previously been comfortable with. In addition, the web app is also a great source to enhance individual problem solving techniques as it doesn't disappoint in regards to debugging and continually tests my strength in all stages of the development and deployment cycle. The ever evolving web application is always hungry for the next update. Deployed on Digital Ocean utilizing bash for Nginx and PM2.</p>
