          <p class="project-description">Web-X is a web app designed for users that want to keep controller layouts consistent throughout multiple FPS games. In my passion for gaming and efficiency I conceptualized the web application Map X. Through construction of a great team we were able to bring the project from idea to reality â€“ with myself focusing primarily on the database, migrations and back-end and front-end logic. Throughout the project I was able to oversee the team for creative and technical guidance while working collaboratively to create the final product.</p>
